# FAQ

## Does it call external services?
Only if you configure a hosted adapter. The demo harness is local and safe by default.

## Can I run a single model?
Yes. The consensus layer still produces an auditable decision artifact.

## How do I add a new model adapter?
Add a model entry in the config and implement the adapter interface described in docs.

## Is this production ready?
Not yet. It is an early-stage project intended for evaluation and experimentation. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
